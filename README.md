# ASCIIArtCreator
ASCII Art Creator:

A tool for generating ASCII art from an image file.

Supported formats: .jpg and .png (tested so far).

The generator includes an option to automatically create a custom outline or disable it.

It also offers various palettes, useful for generating different types of images, such as low-contrast, high-contrast, and high-color-range images.

The primary purpose of this generator is to convert pixel art into ASCII, as most online generators do not handle pixel art well. (At least I couldn't find any)
